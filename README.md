# ImageProcessing
Image Processing assignments get a grasp of it.

## Assignment 1
1. Implement all intensity transformation from Figure 3.3 (Identity, Negative, Log, nth root, nth power, inverse log). Use either gray-level transform of the attached image, or choose an image at your discretion (preferably to show the effect of each filter).
2. Implement color piecewise linear transformation function that given proper ranges ((A,B) for each channel from Figure 3.11), can detect vegetables with a certain color range (or the background) from the attached image (peppers.png).
